## 6.1 A New Day

Ivandale rises from a peaceful sleep, renewed and invigorated. Limited in the confined quarters of his tent, he slips out and is met by the rising early-morning sun. Tinkerella is already awake and playfully tossing daisy blossoms to her pika for breakfast.

The two adventurers turn to the sound of quiet footsteps treading through the dewy grass. Zaf, the miner-turned-guardsman, smiles and holds up a stack of bowls and a long handled soup pot. "Just the two I wanted to see! Daran asked for ya." He eyes the pika as it darts into Tinkerella's lap, but shakes off his surprise, "I'll wake the rest. Soups still hot!"

Tinkerella helps her pika into her jacket pocket and they walk through the apple trees to Daran's cabin, letting themselves in. The captured Redbrand is still lashed to a chair, a gag in his mouth.

Daran beams a warm smile to them as they enter and then retrieves a bow and small pack from the corner of the room. "Thanks for coming. I imagine you're both hungry and looking forward to some stew, but I wanted to give you these first."

"Phandalin has been struggling with the Redbrands for awhile now. As you can see it hasn't been going in our favor. I think maybe you're the help we need." The old fighter pauses a moment and then hands the bow to Ivandale. "This bow served me well while I wore the Red Larch. It belongs in the hands of a new Ranger now."

Ivandale looks over the bow admires it's impressive strength and sleek finish. He brings it up and pulls back on the string, mocking an attack against the unconscious prisoner. Pleased with the action of the bow, Ivandale smiles and gentle releases the pressure on the bowstring. "Thank you Daran. With such a fine weapon, our victory against these thugs is assured!"

Daran chuckles and turns to Tinkerella. "Zaf detailed the fight in town. I understand your healing skills keep this crew of yours on their feet! Here's something to compliment your abilities."

Tinkerella takes the pack from Daran's outstretched hands. She places it on the ground and opens the flap to find bandages and tinctures. She laughs and thanks him, tossing the bag over her shoulder.

"I'm willing to bet the rest of your group is eating breakfast. I suggest you join them. I'll be here if you need me."

Tinkerella smiles and leaves the cabin, closely followed by Ivandale still admiring his new bow. They arrive back at the tents while Nalfos is in the middle of explaining a plan to Valoric and Zaf.

"We need to get past that thing in the crevice. It wants fresh food," he says. "It doesn't seem very discriminatory. If the Redbrand that Daran captured wont talk, he'll still be useful."

Valoric nods approval and gets up. He walks over to Meza's tent and gives it a shake, "Soup's up."

Zaf asks Nalfos, "Say, have you seen anything valuable while in the crypts?"

Ivandale responds first, startling the miner, "Not so far. Why do you ask?"

Zaf composes himself, "Well, the owners were pretty wealthy. The manor was razed years ago by a band of orcs. The rumor in town is that there's tons of secret entrances and maybe not all of them have been found." He shrugs, "That's the rumor anyway. Old wives tales maybe."

Ivandale walks past the group to his tent. On the way over, he kicks Meza's tent and finally receives a response from the barbarian, "Just'second. Save me some stew!"

He keeps moving and retrieves his trusty bow from alongside his bedroll. "Zaf, we appreciate your help against the Redbrands. I think it's time you took a more active role in this battle. Please, take my bow and put it to good use."

Zaf puts his bowl of soup in the grass and takes the bow. Nodding politely, "Thanks! I sure will!"

Tinkerella passes Ivandale a sly smile and a bowl of stew before sitting down in the grass with her own bowl.

Meza stretches with a resounding yawn. "So what's the plan?" she says, grabbing the warm pot and taking a sip. "I can't wait to bust some more heads!"

"We're taking the Redbrand thug from Daran. He wont talk, so we're going to use him to get past the mind-creature," explains Nalfos.

Meza slurps the last of the stew, and smiles at the elf. Empty pot in hand, she leads the group down to the cabin and approaches the bound Redbrand. He's roused and sitting groggy in the chair.

She winks at the groggy thug as he begins to squirm in his bindings. "Hey stud. We're heading back into the ruins to finish what we started yesterday." She dances two fingers playfully up his chest. "Why don't you give us some information about what we're walking into and maybe we'll let you live."

She roughly pulls the gag from his mouth and he spits, "Gross! I'm not helping you! I'm not..." A violent 'Klang!' interupts his protest as Meza smashes the side of the stew pot against his head. He slumps backwards in the seat.

Meza readjusts the gag and throws a wink towards Tinkerella, "I love it when they play hard to get."

Nalfos rebinds the ropes around the thug's wrists and ankles. Meza tosses the limp bandit over her shoulder and they march towards the Redbrand's hideout.

As they approach, they notice campfire smoke climbing into the sky from the rear of the building. Ivandale offers to scout ahead, asking the party to stay behind. He sneaks along the edge of the ruined foundation and discovers an empty campsite. Large footprints appear near a smoldering fire, but it appears empty.

He begins a return to the group and trips on a chunk of foundation. A roar of laughter erupts from behind him. He turns in time to see a bugbear charging at him, driving the head of a massive morningstar towards his skull.

The elf deftly pivots at the last moment and avoids the blow. He lets loose a loud "help!" and scrambles backwards. The bugbear advances as the group dashes into the battle. Meza and Valoric lead the charge.

Ivandale gets to his feet and disengages back to meet the group before the bugbear can lift it's heavy weapon from the dusty ground. Frustrated that the scrawny elf has slipped away, the bugbear takes a massive swing at Meza and connects with her shoulder.

Valoric hacks at the bugbear's exposed side with his axe. Seemingly unfazed by the attack, Meza swings her battle axe into the bugbear's opposite flank.

Tinkerella stretches her hands wide, conjuring an arc of flame. She brings her hands together, focusing the draft forward and expertly weaves her spell between the two fighters. The conjured flame collides with the bugbear's broad chest, stealing it's last breath and sending the beast soaring backwards.

As the excitement of combat begins to wear off, Meza realizes how hard she's been hit. She drops her axe and rubs the meat of her shoulder, wincing in pain. Tinkerella runs up and tells the barbarian to sit. She reaches into the medical pack and begins to apply a tincture. The medicine quickly takes action. The bruised muscle quickly turns to yellow as Meza flexes the muscles in her arms. She ruffles the small druid's wild hair and thanks her.

She then grabs the still unconscious Rebrand and they head through the secret entrance leading to the demon's lair.

## 7.2 Bartering

As they enter, the creature's voice echoes through their minds. "You bring Nothic meat?" It hops onto the ledge near them.

Meza tosses the bandit into the crevice and Nothic dives in. It tears into the Redbrand's flesh, desperately seeking organs. As it eats, sounds of joyous glee ring through their minds.

While the creature is distracted, Ivandale creeps past. The way appears clear and he beckons the group to follow him through a doorway into the next room.

By the time they've all escaped the grizzly scene, Ivandale has already rifled through many of the dilapidated crates. "Not much here. These beaver pelts might sell though," he says before moving to the eastern wall. "I think there's something here. Give me a second."

He runs his hand across the wall until he finds a loose stone. With a light push, the wall pops inward on a hinge. He smiles to the group and disappears inside.

Inside, he finds a small hallway with two more doors. Noting that the door on his right is slightly ajar, he approaches it first. He places a hand on the door and listens momentarily for signs of life. Satisfied that the opposite room is empty, he gives the door a light shove. It opens into the room containing the three sarcophaguses and skeletons. The remains of their previous battle haven't been upset further. The bones of the skeletal archers at his feet are menacing, but idle.

Not wanting to upset Meza he backs up, pulling the door closed behind him, and checks the second door. After confirming an absence of traps, he twists the handle. The door clicks and opens towards him. Inside, he finds some weapons, filthy red cloaks, and dented crates bearing the blue crest of the Lionshield Coster.

Nalfos peers over his shoulder. "This must be the Redbrand's Armory."

Valoric responds, "Weapons and armor? If we can keep them from it, we may have an easier time with them."

Nalfos nods, "Let's toss it into the crevice. If we've won the favor of the demon, maybe he'll guard this gear. Only a madman would jump in with that thing."

Valoric and Meza agree. Nalfos collects red cloaks for each member of the group in case disguises will be useful later.

Ivandale turns to the western wall of the storage room as they begin transferring the gear to the crevice. He recognizes it as a false wall, but is unable to find a mechanism in the pristine surface.

Meza hurls a second batch of weapons into the crevice and the demon speaks directly to their minds again. "More gifts for Nothic! Nothic likes treasure!"

Nalfos responds, "Do you like treasure Nothic?"

"Oh yes!" comes the response. "Nothic collects treasure!"

Nalfos is unable to hide his interest as Nothic climbs over the edge once more. "We've brought you many pieces of treasure, will you trade?"

Nothic carefully examines the elf for a moment. "No. You save Droop, then Nothic trade."

"Droop? Who's Droop?"

Nothic continues to focus it's one massive eye on Nalfos while responding telepathically, "Droop is goblin. Droop is Nothic's only friend. Save Droop from the bugbears and Nothic gives you a mighty weapon!"

"I heard a goblin being beaten on by those bugbears last night," Valoric says, "We can't fight them in that hallway though. We need a strategy."

"Nothic will scream. Bugbears hate when Nothic screams."

Surprised by Nothic's creativity, the adventurers hide along the cave walls and behind the pillars. The echo of a blood curdling telepathic scream rends their minds. It's followed shortly by the roar of an angry bugbear from beyond the stairwell. The door below slams open and a wailing goblin rushes to the top of the stairs. His face is tortured and pitiful. One of his eyes is swollen and rimmed with a purple bruise. His lip is recently torn and bleeding.

Droop pleads with Nothic in the guttural goblin language. A seemingly one-sided conversation as Nothic responds directly to the sobbing goblin telepathically. Suddenly, the goblin says one word that can be understood by the group. A word that doesn't exist in the goblin language, "Friends?"

Nothic's next response fills the minds of everyone in the room. "Draw the bugbears out and they will kill the bugbears for us! Mosk wont hurt Droop any longer!"

Droop dries his eyes on ragged sleeves and draws himself up. He turns and bounds down the stairs quickly. His voice becomes muffled as he thrusts his head through the door. "Mosk come quick! Nothic caught an intruder! Come before Nothic eats it!"

Droop skips up the stairs as two pairs of heavy footsteps ascend behind him. The first bugbear enters the room and grabs the goblin by the neck. "Move stupid goblin!" He hurls Droop across the crevice and into the far wall. The pale green-skinned goblin crumbles into a small, unmoving heap.

The adventurers wait until the second bugbear appears at the top of the stairway. The leader is massive. It wears a jewel encrusted eye-patch loosely over one eye. "Where intruder Nothic? You don't eat until me says!"

Meza uses the bugbear's voice to guide her attack and throws herself from behind the nearby pillar. She drives her axe down into the side of the surprised bugbear. Mosk turns towards his attacker, and Ivandale lunges from the shadows. He drives the thin point of his rapier into the bugbears throat and wrenches it free. Mosk gurgles and reaches a weak hand toward the opening as his life blood spills to the floor.

Nalfos and Tinkerella each cast their spells of flame. Both spells twist wide of the combatants, but the second bugbear sees that the battle is lost. It turns to retreat back down the stairs, but runs into Valoric as he blocks the path. Confused and terrified, it swings it's spiked morningstar in a desperate arc. It misses Valoric, but the rusted spikes nearly rake Meza.

Ivandale fires an arrow from his bow into the bugbear's exposed back. The sudden pain causes the monster to lurch. Meza drives her axe in a vicious chop and connects with the wounded bugbear's shoulder.

Nalfos summons another fiery bolt from his spinning diamond. He patiently guides it through an opening in the fray and the spell strikes the bugbear's thick skull with enough force to nearly separate it from the neck. The smaller bugbear crumples to the ground alongside it's ally.

Concerned that Nothic will turn on them if it's friend perishes, Nalfos darts over to check on the goblin. He reaches under the ratty excuse for a hood to find a pulse. The touch rouses the battered goblin, it's beady eyes flash open and tears begin to well up in their corners. Before Nalfos can pull his hand back, the goblin throws it's arms around him. "Thanks you friend!"

Nalfos pats the goblin, "Er, yes. We're friends now."

## 7.3 Spoils

The adventurers are frozen in place as Nothic telepathically releases a sound of glee. "You saved Nothic's friend. Nothic reward you!" He points a curved finger into a far corner of the crevice cloaked in shadow.

Nalfos takes advantage of the interruption and peels the goblin's arms from his torso. He slips into the crevice, quickly followed by the now boisterous goblin. They retrieve a chest and a longsword, hoisting them up to the ledge. The goblin scrambles out as Ivandale assists Nalfos.

As Nalfos opens the chest and begins to evaluate the riches, Droop looks over to the corpse of  Mosk. He's elated to be free of the tyrant and runs over to the giant beast's ugly face. He kicks it and then rips the jeweled eye-patch loose. Unsure of how to wear it, he steps into it and pulls it up to his waist like a belt and proudly displays the eye-covering like a garish belt-buckle.

Ivandale slips away from the group and scouts the rooms at the bottom of the stairs. He finds the Bugbear's barracks to his left. Three foul and decrepit beds each sit along the walls. A pile of filthy rags mark Droop's quarters.

Disgusted by the smell, he makes his way out and to the opposite door. Inside he finds the human's meeting area. Several make-shift tables and stools are in the room. Cards, dice, and empty bottles on each.

The group enters behind Ivandale. "Not much of value. Looks like the Redbrands cleared out last night." He picks up a pair of diamond earrings and holds them up, "Except these I suppose. Anyone interested?"

Droop tugs at Nalfos's sleeve and the sorcerer looks down into pleading eyes, "Sure, you can have them Droop."

The goblin gleefully runs forward as Ivandale holds them out low. He grabs them quickly and haphazardly jams the posts into his unpierced, green ears.

Ivandale quickly moves out of the range of the blood spray and continues towards the opposite door. He listens for a moment and is surprised to hear bubbling and dripping noises. The door opens easily into a small laboratory. Rows of test tubes sit on a large table dominating the center of the room. Percolating flasks bubble and drip on the cluttered workspace. Nalfos inspects the remains of an experiment.

Ivandale scans a bookshelf in the back of the room for anything valuable. Most of it's contents are in a late state of decay. He pulls a single resilient tome from the shelf and flips through it's musty pages. The glyphs are unknown to him, but Tinkerella notices the title on the cover.

"I think that's dwarven," she says. "Can I hold on to it Ivan?"

He shrugs and hands it to her with a smile. As she struggles to insert the book into her bag, Ivandale inspects the opposite wall. A small rat scurries out of a dark corner past him and runs up to Tinkerella while she's hunched over her bag.

She stops struggling for a moment and waves to the rat. It waves back causing her to giggle. "Hello Mr. Rat! Are you all alone down here?"

The rat squeaks several times and nods it's small head affirmatively before bounding to Droop. The goblin reaches down and picks up the rat, cradling it in his arms. It struggles, nips his fingers and runs under the bookcases.

Meza shoves a door on the east side of the room open and walks into a bedchamber, followed by Valoric. He rifles through the draws of a desk while Meza searches the bed in the far corner.

Valoric picks up a sheet of paper from the top of a stack on the desk. He skims it quickly and says aloud, "This letter is addressed to 'Iarno'. Does that name ring a bell?"

Ivandale eases into the room and answers, "We heard it during our first evening at the Stonehill Inn. He was a villager who was captured by the Redbrands. What does that say about him?"

"Not about him. It's addressed to him!" responds Valoric. "It warns that there are four adventurers heading to town." He looks up and scans the group as Nalfos and Tinkerella enter, "I'm guessing that's you four. He was supposed to dispatch the four of you quickly. Something about you working for some dwarves."

"Gundren," Nalfos chimes in. "He's the dwarf that hired us."

"Apparently Gundren had some maps that 'a black spider' wants."

Ivandale gathers the remaining papers from the desk and Valoric hands him the letter. The elf carefully adds the papers to his bag to review later. He then inspects the eastern wall, finding another hidden switch. The door quietly opens, revealing a set of stairs leading up to the storage room near Nothic's crevice.

Droops leads them out and skips to Nothic who is uncharacteristically standing outside of the crevice. A threat etches into their minds, "All of you must leave. Leave now and not return!"

"But, but friend Nothic," Droop says, visibly shaking. "They are friends!"

"Master says I should kill them, but they are good to Nothic. Nothic let you leave this time!"

They pass Nothic single file. The creature mournfully watches them pass as they walk through the only door they have not entered.

The room inside contains a few cots and food stores used by the Redbrands. Nalfos pulls a red cloak from a peg and helps Droop into it. Meza and Valoric sift through crates, retrieving packs of preserved meats and hard tack.

Meza hands canvas bags of the perishables to the rest of the group. "Let's bring this back to Daran. He'll put it to good use."

They exit through the opposite door, opening into the room containing the ancient cistern. They cross and quickly ascend the rear stairwell into the blinding afternoon sun.
