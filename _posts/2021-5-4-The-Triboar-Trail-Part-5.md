## 5.1 The Orchard

The adventurers return to the Stonehill Inn and order lunch. As they wait for their meals, a young elven cleric enters the tavern. She thanks them for standing up to the Redbrands while savory aromas spread from the kitchen. She bestows Tymora's blessing upon them and exits the inn. 

As she leaves, a large, well-armored human with jet black hair and grey eyes fills the doorframe. An axe rests at his hip and a large shield is strapped to his back. Admiring his armor, Meza smiles and waves him over. Nalfos requests an additional plate for the adventurer and asks his purpose in town.

The knight responds, "My name is Valoric. I've heard that Phandalin was experiencing trouble and I wanted to assist."

They all eat a hearty lunch. Each makes a proper introduction with their new companion and they detail their adventure so far.

As the bill is settled, the Innkeep comments, "I heard what ye did. Mighty noble of ya. You're not the only ones in Phandalin who are ready to tussle with those thugs. You should talk to Daran. You'll find him to be like-minded. My son Pip can show you the way."

They exit the tavern and follow the innkeeper's cheery son. He leads them north past Barthen's Provisions. Just before exiting town, the lad heads left down a long dirt road. Apple trees are arranged in rows on their right. As they near the end, the rows of apple trees lead to a small cottage.

An arrow sails by the group, flung by a bowman hidden in shadows near the house. Caught off-guard, the group readies their weapons. Pip abandons the group and runs back to the safety of the inn.

A gruff voice commands their attention, "That's the only warning you'll receive if you're here for trouble. What are you doing on my property!"

Shield half raised, Valoric steps forward and speaks for the group. "We mean no harm, we were sent to ask for your aid. We're here to assist the town of Phandalin. We only mean to speak with Daran."

A gray-haired man steps into the morning sunlight and lowers his bow. "Well, if you mean to speak to me, it'd be safer to do so inside. C'mon then." He eases the front door of the cottage open and disappears inside.

They all file in as Daran returns his bow to it's resting place over the hearth. A skilled archer himself, Ivandale steps up to the hearth to appreciate the bow. It's expertly crafted and very worn. He turns to ask Daran where he acquired it. As he turns, his eyes catch sight of a plaque on the wall bearing a red larch tree.

Ivandale smiles a warm smile and reveals an identical emblem embroidered in the collar of his cloak. "Tinkerella and I are also Rangers of Red Larch. I didn't realize one of our own was stationed in Phandalin!"

"Stationed? No. Retired. Quietly I had hoped, but adventure found me here I'm afraid." A wry smile spreads across his haggard face. "Still, you're a welcome sight. I'm glad to see competent hands have finally arrived in Phandalin. I've tried to secretly arm the citizens, but it's a small town and they aren't trained."

"What can you tell us of the Redbrands?" Nalfos asks. "Do you know their number? Where they can be found?"

"There's about two dozen of them. They hole up in the Sleeping Giant on the East side of town usually."

"Only two dozen? Then we've already thinned their ranks, considerably," responds Ivandale. "We should scout the Sleeping Giant next."

"You're our scout Ivandale," Nalfos says. "If you're ready, I can create a mental link between us. You'll be able to scout without our hinderance and tell me what you see." He leans over to Ivandale and speaks an incantation while manipulating two small, linked silver rings.

As the incantation is completed, Ivandale hears a question form in his mind. "Can you hear me?"

Ivandale responds telepathically, "Yes. When we're done here, you owe me more truth."

Turning to the group Ivandale breaks the silence. "It's done. We should go now."

## 5.2 The Sleeping Giant

Daran wishes them luck and waves them off as they leave his orchard. They walk into town without incident and turn up the road heading east towards the Sleeping Giant tavern. The decrepit remnants of Tresendar Manor stand like the skeleton of a fallen beast at the end of the snaking roadway.

Trees and unkept bushes provide cover for the group along the side of the road. Ivandale slips through a side yard and sneaks behind neighboring buildings until he is able to inspect the back of the Sleeping Giant. No doors exist on this side of the building, but careful examination reveals a secret entrance. He telepathically shares the discovery with Nalfos who relays the information to the rest of the group.

Tinkerella suggests creating a distraction near the front door so that Ivandale can slip into the building. "I bet a goblin would distract them. I can't make it say anything, but I can make the shape of one run into those bushes over there. That would get their attention!"

Nalfos smirks, thinking of the goblin packs they fought just yesterday. "If you can trick their eyes, I can create a suitable fracas."

He conveys to Ivandale, "We're going to try and draw them out. When you hear a ruckus, that's your queue."

Moments later, Ivandale hears the shrill cry of an angry taunting goblin. The cacophony raises a small chorus of confusion from inside the building and the inhabitants clamor through the front door.

The roguish elf pulls against the secret door and slips inside a dusty store room full of large kegs. A female dwarven barkeep stands on his side of the bar, preoccupying herself by rubbing a filthy glass with a stained rag.

Two red-clad humans return to the bar. The taller one says, "I don't know what that was, but I'm not taking chances. I'm going to head up to the den. Tell them something may be amiss. Just in case. I'll send the other two into town and see what's going on. You stay here. Watch the place."

His associate places an empty glass on the bar nonchalantly and nods in agreement before heading to the front of the tap house.

Ivandale telepathically notifies Nalfos, "A messenger is about to exit the front door, he's going to what they called 'the den'." Two others are heading into town."

The response is hurried and quick. "Two of them just ran past us on their way into town. I think the messenger is leaving now. It looks like he's heading towards the ruins of the manor. Valoric is close to him, but he can't get the jump on him without being seen."

Ivandale slips back out through the trap door. As he looks down the road heading east he catches sight of the lone messenger. He nocks an arrow and reaches out to Nalfos. "Get ready. We need to maintain our element of surprise."

He releases the arrow. It arcs through the air and catches his prey in the leg, sending him tumbling to the ground. The bandit stands on his good leg and attempts to hobble away. Valoric jumps from the bushes nearby with his axe raised. He brings it down on the bandit with a single stroke.

The lone guard turns to the commotion on the road and pulls his sword. Tinkerella and Nalfos simultaneously hurl magical fire at the doorman. The combined force sends him stumbling into the entryway. The flames licking and scorching the doorframe. He ducks inside to safety.

"Ivandale, Tink and I hurt one, but he's retreated inside."

Ivandale sneaks back in and draws his bow. The charred outlaw is reaching over the bar top towards the retreating dwarf. "My medicine, give it to me! Give me the potion!"

Feeling no pity for the bandit, Ivandale quietly nocks another arrow and releases it. The arrow passes the short distance across the room hitting the bandit between the eyes. The Redbrand slumps over the bar, his outstretched hand falling limply.

Ivandale relaxes his bow, as the shocked dwarven woman spins in his direction. He puts a hand on his rapier. "What potion is he talking about? Have you been helping these men? Are they patrons or allies?"

"I don't have any potions! I'm just a lone bar keep! I couldn't drive them away by myself."

"And the potion he begged you for?"

"He was a twisted drunk! He called my ales potions. That's all."

Ivandale shoves the secret door open. "If I find out you've allied with these men, I'll come back for you." He carefully exits, and slams the door violently behind him.

He rejoins the group at the front of the Sleeping Giant. Ivandale removes and pockets the messenger's red cloak before Meza moves the body in the brush, hiding it from sight.

"Two of them went into town. We should check on them," Tinkerella states nervously. Fear for the townspeople straining her usually exuberant voice.

"You're right," Meza agrees. "Their den hasn't been notified. It can wait a little longer."

They walk west into town, retracing their steps in the old rutted road. Turning into the town square they see the two Redbrands are bruised, battered and held at sword point by Daran and Toblen the innkeeper.

Daran smiles at the group. "We've got these two handled you lot. Don't worry about us!"

## 5.3 The Manor

Inspired by the villager's bravery, they return up the eastern road and enter the grounds of the rotting manor. Once mighty beams of timber hang askew at odd angles as the roof threatens to collapse completely. Very little remains intact, save a stone staircase at the rear of the building.

The group approaches the staircase leading down to a musty basement level. Valoric and Meza are the first to enter. The more nimble members follow behind. At the bottom of the stairs they find an old storeroom containing several decaying kegs and crates. A closed door is embedded in the wall next to a murky cistern at the eastern end of the room. Another door built into the northern wall also remains closed near the bottom of the stairs.

Valoric chooses the closer door and pushes it open carefully. On the other side they discover a short hallway leading to a single door. The two human fighters push in cautiously, weapons raised. Suddenly, the floor gives way. Meza tumbles backwards into Nalfos, but Valoric is unable to shift in time. He slips into a pit as the the floor collapses under his feet.

Tinkerella moves to the edge of the trap and finds a narrow strip of floor which can be carefully traversed. Her small feet easily find purchase and she stops to guide Meza. As they cross, Ivandale vaults the span and reaches down to pull Valoric from the opposite side of the trap.

After Nalfos crosses, Ivandale inspects the door. "Clearly I should keep an eye out for more traps. Let me take a look..." The sturdy door is secure, but not trapped. He draws his thieves tools and expertly opens the ancient lock with ease. Unlatched, the door swings open.

Valoric enters a seemingly vacant room. Lit torches hang in sconces near a door on the far wall. Their flames throw dancing shadows across three tall tombs. The skeletal remains of three bodies lie on the floor.

As Meza enters, the flickering torchlight plays across the empty eye-sockets and bare teeth of the skeletons. She collapses in panic with a terrified scream. Seemingly animated by Meza's fear, the skeletons begin to stand and raise their weapons.

Valoric charges up to the closest animated skeleton, but his attack is parried by a rusted sword. Nalfos also attacks the thing before it can bring itself completely upright. Afraid to hit the noble paladin, the sorcerer's conjured bolt of fire arcs wide of his target and hits the sarcophagus behind the skeletal footman.

As the two skeletal archers along the far end of the room draw brittle arrows, Ivandale darts in to assist Valoric. With a flourish of his rapier, the rogue takes off the skeleton's left arm. The decaying shield falls to the ground. Rotting wood splinters and crumbles.

Ivandale ducks behind the closest sarcophagus as the two archers release a volley of arrows. Valoric deflects one with his shield, but the other finds it's mark in an unprotected opening in his armor.

Tinkerella takes advantage of the opening created by Ivandale's attack and conjures a blast of flame. The attack hits the skeleton in the torso. Spine and ancient ribs snap and burst. Fragments skitter across the ground. Mortally wounded, the skeleton suffers it's final death.

Nalfos again hurls a fiery bolt, but misses both of the undead archers. Valoric moves to the enemy archers. Ivandale follows Valoric and thrusts his rapier into a skeleton. He's unable to connect with the hollow form of his target and he steps back defensively.

Meza shakes her fear off and joins her friends in the fray. The mighty barbarian charges to Valoric's side and recklessly attacks one of the skeletons. She smashes the handle of the axe against the skeleton, knocking bits of bone free. Abandoning it's bow, it reaches for her. Exposed digits rake her arm causing blood to blossom in their wake.

Tinkerella moves up beside Meza. The small gnome is easily overlooked when standing under the hulking mass of her ally. She reaches towards the skeleton and conjures another magical flame. The flame bursts forward under the skeleton's torso spreading into it's rib cage. The sudden burst rips the skeleton in half. The bones fall to the floor and cease to move.

Valoric cleaves the last skeleton rending the undead archer's frayed leather armor and crushing it's rib cage. The thing still stands, though it struggles to maintain an upright posture.

Frustrated, Nalfos is unable to find an opening between his allies. He hurls a fiery bolt with caution. The magic misses the target and smashes into the far wall. The force of the impact violently shakes the crypt walls.

Ivandale sheathes his rapier as he climbs on to the stone sarcophagi. Unable to join the melee, he draws his bow and lets an arrow fly at close range. The shot rips through the opening created by Valoric's axe and severs the spine. The skeleton collapses in a clatter of bone.

Nalfos begins to lift the lids of the sarcophagi. "We should make sure there aren't more. Just in case we have to come back through here." He finds very little inside, except a single platinum ring. Both Nalfos and Ivandale inspect the ring. Ivandale is unimpressed, but Nalfos believes the loop may hold a minor enchantment. He pockets it for further inspection later.

A heavy door stands on the East side of the room. Valoric tries the handle, but is unable to turn it. He steps back and as the excitement of combat subsides, he realizes the degree of his injures. He takes a knee and requests a healing blessing from Helm, the god of guardians.

As the mighty power fills Valoric's body, soothing his more serious wounds, Ivandale steps forward to check the door for traps. Finding the door unprotected, he carefully inserts a thin sliver of metal into the keyhole and sets to work. The lock pops and the elf steps back, bowing to the recovered paladin.

Valoric pulls the door open and takes two steps into the dark room. Before his human eyes are able to adjust, a sword blade flashes across his left side. He turns in time to parry the blade, but the maneuver leaves his shoulder exposed to another attack from the right side.

Nalfos conjures another fiery bolt and hurls it into the room. He misses the combatants, but the screams of frightened villagers ring through the chamber.

Ivandale snakes his blade between Valoric and the door jam, but the flimsy strike is deflected. He retreats to the crypt room allowing Meza to push in. She awkwardly swings her axe at the bandit behind Valoric as she finds firm ground inside by a pile of discarded clothes and rags. The bandit retaliates, but is unable to capitalize on Meza's clumsy entrance.

The other bandit strikes Valoric. He deflects the sword with his shield and follows up with a chop from his axe. The bandit takes a defensive leap backwards into the rusted bars behind him. Three captive villagers cower in the corners within the cages of what was once a secure storage room.

Nalfos has followed Meza into the room. He conjures another fiery bolt at Meza's bandit, but the bandit dodges the spell. Tinkerella is able to safely scamper through the fray unnoticed.

Ivandale again snakes a sword attack into the room. He strikes the bandit who is pinned against the bars and opens a fatal wound. The bandit falls backward and slides to the floor, leaving a glistening trail of blood on the bars.

Meza, still raging in the small space swings her battle axe wildly. Tinkerella ducks the gigantic axe's arc as she conjures another flame. She slips backwards and looses control of her flame. Nalfos takes the blast full in the face.

Laughing at the series of events, the remaining bandit stabs Nalfos in the gut. The elf collapses. Valoric brings his axe blade down into the bandit's back.

Enraged by the sight of his friend falling to the floor, Ivandale charges into the room. He leads with his rapier, skewering the Redbrand through the back. He wrenches the blade sideways, severing the spine and shoves the dead bandit head-first into the wall with a violent crack.

Tinkerella bursts with tears and apologies. She throws herself to the ground and heals Nalfos. He sits up coughing as her magic slowly repairs the singed flesh and knits together the wound in his belly.

Meanwhile, Ivandale once again retrieves his thieves tools and unlocks the cell doors. "Do any of you know who their leader is?"

The woman who was alone in the northern cell runs to embrace her two children. Between sobs she responds, "There's a mage. He wears red robes. He has two hideous creatures with him at all time. They look like giant man-bears. They're absolutely horrible and smell wretched!"

Nalfos and Tinkerella each retrieve and pocket the red cloaks from the two bandits. They escort the villagers back to the stairs leading out of the basement.

"Thank you so much for saving us. I can't possibly repay you," says the woman through sobs. "My family are refugees from Thundertree. We were forced to flee. I left behind an heirloom. I can tell you were we left it if you're brave enough to recover it."
